# Algorithm Visualizer

A simple web-based application to **visualize sorting algorithms** in action. The project demonstrates how different sorting techniques work step by step with animations and optional sound effects.

---

## 🚀 Features

* Visualize popular sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, etc.).
* Adjustable speed to see sorting in slow motion or fast mode.
* Color-coded bars representing array values.
* Sound effects for better visualization feedback.
* Responsive and clean UI built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
